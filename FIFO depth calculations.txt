FIFO Operating Conditions:

Producer clk1 frequency = 240 MHz 
Consumer clk2 frequency = 400 MHz 
With duty-cycle of 50%. 
Max writes Burst size = 512. 
Num. of idle cycle between successive writes = 0. 
Num. of idle cycles between successive reads = 2.


The no. of idle cycles between two successive writes is 1 clock cycle. It means that, after writing one data, Producer is waiting for 0 clock cycles, to initiate the next write. 
So, it can be understood that for every clock cycle, one data is written. 

The no. of idle cycles between two successive reads is 2 clock cycles. It means that, after reading one data, Consumer is waiting for 2 clock cycles, to initiate the next read. So, 
it can be understood that for every 3 clock cycles, one data is read.
 
Time required to write one data item = (1) x (1/(240*106)) = 4.17ns.  
Time required to write all the data in the burst = 512 x 4.17ns = 2133.5ns.

Time required to read one data item = (3) x (1/(400*106)) = 7.5ns.
So, for every 12 ns, the consumer is going to read one data item in the burst. In a period of 1800ns, 300 data items can be written. 

The no. of data items can be read in a period of 2133.5 ns = (2133.5ns/7.5ns) = 284.47 data items.
The remaining no. of bytes to be stored in the FIFO = 512 - 284.47 = 227.53. 

So, the FIFO which has to be in this scenario must be capable of storing 228 data items.
